This program is a timesheet for billing clients.
It takes user input from textboxes, dropdown, and radio buttons, then calculates the time spent per client, generating a ledger at the bottom of the page with a running total of hours. The program provides rounding options for different billing i.e., “15min”, “30min”, or “60min”.
