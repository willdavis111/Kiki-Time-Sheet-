This program is a timesheet for billing clients.
It takes user input from textboxes, dropdown, and radio buttons, then calculates the time spent per client, generating a ledger on the side of the page with a running total of hours. The program provides rounding options for different billing i.e., “15min”, “30min”, or “60min”. 
After the legder is created users can generate a bar chart if the hours spent on each client, and a pie chart of time spent on tasks.
